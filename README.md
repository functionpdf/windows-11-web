# WIN11 WEB
## abstract
I began this project at the beginning of 2023, and aim to finish it by August of 2024. This was mainly a means to present my portfolio in a unique way. 
## progress check
Still a work in progress as of Feb 2024 ;(
Add: custom drop down menu, light/dark theme switch, enable scrolling within modal window, resizing of modal windows, make prettier
+ content
## permissions
You can use this(although there are really much better templates to use out there), but please just credit me lol.
